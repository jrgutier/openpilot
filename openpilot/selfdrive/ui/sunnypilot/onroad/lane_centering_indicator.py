"""
Shows which way lane centering is nudging the car and how hard.

The correction is a curvature delta, which means nothing to a driver, so it is shown as the
sideways push it produces: push = correction * vEgo^2, in m/s^2. Away from the lookahead
clamps that reduces to 2 * (distance off center beyond the deadband) * gain, which is why the
reading tracks the strength setting rather than cancelling it out.

The widget runs at two rates. The bar is live, redrawn every frame, so a lane gate dropout of a
few frames still shows. Everything written in words or figures is latched: it is replaced twice a
second by the average of the window just ended, because a number redrawn 20 times a second cannot
be read at all, and near the tolerance the state itself flickers.

Direction is carried by which side of the center detent the bar fills, and by the L or R after
the distance off center, so color is free to carry effort and state. The two numbers, the push
and the distance, share a size and a color so they read as a pair; every word and unit beside
them is plain white. It is all one face: the units were set in the medium weight and read as an
afterthought beside two bold numbers, so they are bold too, and only size separates them now.
